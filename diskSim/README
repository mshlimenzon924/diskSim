Name: Mira Shlimenzon
Functionality: My program is fully functional. C-LOOK and C-SCAN are both running on the assumption that the disk can only be scanned from low to high addresses. 


To make diskSim.py executable 
1. rm diskSim
2. ln -s diskSim.py diskSim
3. chmod +x diskSim
You should now be able to run the executable without the .py extension
