Name: Mira Shlimenzon
Functionality: My program is fully functional. One of the personal choices I made is to make the c_scan and c_look functions only read in the 0-4999 direction as many sources online and in class discussion made this seem like the case.
Using this information, my program functions as expected.

To make diskSim.py executable 
1. rm diskSim
2. ln -s diskSim.py diskSim
3. chmod +x diskSim
You should now be able to run the executable without the .py extension
